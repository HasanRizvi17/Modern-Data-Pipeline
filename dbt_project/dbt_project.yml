# Blueprint of our dbt project. It tells dbt:
# - Project name & version → so dbt knows what it’s running.
# - Where your models live → e.g., models/ folder.
# - How to materialize models (table, view, incremental).
# - Configurations for tests, docs, snapshots, seeds, macros, etc.
# - Any overrides (like setting schema names, tags, custom paths)

# These configurations specify where dbt should look for different types of files.
# The `model-paths` config, for example, states that models in this project can be found in the "models/" directory. 
# You probably won't need to change these
