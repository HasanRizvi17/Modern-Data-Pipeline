# - Python: You don’t want temporary .pyc files or local virtual environments in Git.
# - dbt: Only your source models matter; compiled models and logs are generated locally.
# - Airflow: DAG caches and logs don’t need to be in version control.
# - OS/Editor: Files like .DS_Store are system-specific and useless to others.
# ✅ Using .gitignore is considered best practice in any project. It ensures your repo contains only the files that matter for collaboration or deployment.
